    "## Theory\n",
    "GradientBoostingRegressor is a machine learning model that uses the gradient boosting algorithm for regression tasks. It builds an ensemble of decision trees in a sequential manner, where each tree corrects the errors of the previous one. The algorithm minimizes a loss function (typically mean squared error for regression) by fitting each new tree to the residuals of the previous predictions. \n",
    "\n",
    "The model function for GradientBoostingRegressor is the sum of the outputs of all decision trees:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ f(x) = \\sum_{t=1}^{T} \\alpha_t h_t(x) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- $f(x)$ is the predicted output.\n",
    "- $T$ is the number of trees.\n",
    "- $\\alpha_t$ is the weight of the $t$-th tree.\n",
    "- $h_t(x)$ is the prediction of the $t$-th tree for input $x$.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Model Training\n",
    "\n",
    "### Forward Pass\n",
    "\n",
    "During training, the forward pass in GradientBoostingRegressor involves iteratively building decision trees, each of which focuses on predicting the residuals (errors) of the previous trees. This helps the model correct errors made by previous trees and refine the predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cost Function\n",
    "\n",
    "The cost function for GradientBoostingRegressor is the loss function used to evaluate how well the model's predictions match the actual outputs. In the case of regression, this is typically the mean squared error (MSE):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ J(\\alpha) = \\frac{1}{m} \\sum_{i=1}^{m}(f(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)})^2 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- $J(\\alpha)$ is the cost function (MSE).\n",
    "- $m$ is the number of training examples.\n",
    "- $f(x^{(i)})$ is the predicted output for the $i$-th example.\n",
    "- $y^{(i)}$ is the actual output for the $i$-th example.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Gradient Boosting\n",
    "\n",
    "GradientBoostingRegressor uses gradient descent to minimize the cost function by fitting new trees to the residuals of the previous prediction. The gradient of the cost function is calculated, and each tree is fit to the negative gradient of the loss function. This process is repeated for each tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "The update for each tree is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ h_t(x) = -\\frac{\\partial J}{\\partial f(x)} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- $h_t(x)$ is the tree added at stage $t$.\n",
    "- $\\frac{\\partial J}{\\partial f(x)}$ is the gradient of the cost function with respect to the prediction at each stage.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Training Process\n",
    "\n",
    "The training process in GradientBoostingRegressor involves the following steps:\n",
    "1. **Initial prediction**: Start with an initial prediction, which is typically the mean of the target variable.\n",
    "2. **Compute residuals**: Calculate the residuals, which are the differences between the actual target values and the current model predictions.\n",
    "3. **Fit decision trees**: Fit a decision tree to the residuals. This tree learns to predict the errors of the current model.\n",
    "4. **Update prediction**: Add the predictions of the new tree to the current prediction.\n",
    "5. **Repeat**: Repeat the above steps until the desired number of trees is reached or the model stops improving.\n",
    "\n",
    "GradientBoostingRegressor uses a learning rate ($\\alpha$) to control the contribution of each new tree. Smaller learning rates lead to more trees being used, while larger learning rates speed up the training but may increase the risk of overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "By iteratively improving the model through decision trees, GradientBoostingRegressor can learn complex patterns in the data and achieve high accuracy in regression tasks.\n"

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Description:**\n",
    "- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** is a widely used metric for evaluating the accuracy of regression models.\n",
    "- It measures the average squared difference between the predicted values ($y_{\\text{pred}}$) and the actual target values ($y_{\\text{true}}$).\n",
    "- The squared differences are averaged across all data points in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interpretation:**\n",
    "- A lower MSE indicates a better fit of the model to the data, as it means the model's predictions are closer to the actual values.\n",
    "- MSE is sensitive to outliers because the squared differences magnify the impact of large errors.\n",
    "- **Limitations:**\n",
    "  - MSE can be hard to interpret because it is in squared units of the target variable.\n",
    "  - It disproportionately penalizes larger errors due to the squaring process.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "### 2. Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Description:**\n",
    "- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)** is a variant of MSE that provides the square root of the average squared difference between predicted and actual values.\n",
    "- It is often preferred because it is in the same unit as the target variable, making it more interpretable.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interpretation:**\n",
    "- Like MSE, a lower RMSE indicates a better fit of the model to the data.\n",
    "- RMSE is also sensitive to outliers due to the square root operation.\n",
    "- **Advantages over MSE:**\n",
    "  - RMSE provides a more intuitive interpretation since it is in the same scale as the target variable.\n",
    "  - It can be more directly compared to the values of the actual data.\n",

    "- It ranges from 0 to 1, where 0 indicates that the model does not explain any variance, and 1 indicates a perfect fit.\n",

    "- A higher $R^2$ value suggests that the model explains a larger proportion of the variance in the target variable.\n",
    "- However, $R^2$ does not provide information about the goodness of individual predictions or whether the model is overfitting or underfitting.\n",
    "- **Limitations:**\n",
    "  - $R^2$ can be misleading in cases of overfitting, especially with polynomial regression models. Even if $R^2$ is high, the model may not generalize well to unseen data.\n",
    "  - It doesn’t penalize for adding irrelevant predictors, so adjusted $R^2$ is often preferred for models with multiple predictors.\n",

    "- Unlike $R^2$, it can decrease if the additional predictors do not improve the model significantly.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interpretation:**\n",
    "- A higher adjusted $R^2$ suggests that the model is not just overfitting, but has genuine explanatory power with the number of predictors taken into account.\n",

    "**Description:**\n",
    "- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)** measures the average of the absolute errors between the predicted and actual values.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Interpretation:**\n",
    "- MAE provides a straightforward understanding of the average error magnitude.\n",
    "- A lower MAE suggests better model accuracy, but it may not highlight the impact of large errors as much as MSE or RMSE."
