    "## Theory\n",
    "AdaBoostRegressor (Adaptive Boosting Regressor) is a machine learning model that combines multiple weak regressors (typically decision trees) into a strong ensemble. It works by iteratively training regressors while adjusting the weights of training samples based on their prediction errors. Unlike gradient boosting, AdaBoost uses a weighted training set where misclassified samples get higher weights in subsequent iterations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model function for AdaBoostRegressor is a weighted sum of weak regressors:\n",
    "$$ f(x) = \\sum_{t=1}^{T} w_t h_t(x) $$\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- $f(x)$ is the final prediction\n",
    "- $T$ is the number of weak regressors\n",
    "- $w_t$ is the weight assigned to regressor $t$\n",
    "- $h_t(x)$ is the prediction of regressor $t$ for input $x$\n",
    "\n",
    "## Model Training\n",
    "### Forward Pass\n",
    "During training, AdaBoostRegressor iteratively builds weak regressors (typically decision trees) where each regressor tries to correct the errors of the ensemble by focusing on the harder-to-predict samples through sample weighting.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Loss Functions\n",
    "AdaBoostRegressor supports three types of loss functions:\n",
    "1. **Linear**: Uses linear loss for error calculation\n",
    "2. **Square**: Uses squared error loss\n",
    "3. **Exponential**: Uses exponential loss function\n",
    "\n",
    "### AdaBoost.R2 Algorithm\n",
    "AdaBoostRegressor implements the AdaBoost.R2 algorithm which follows these steps:\n",
    "1. Initialize sample weights equally: $D_1(i) = 1/N$\n",
    "2. For each iteration $t=1,\\dots,T$:\n",
    "   - Train weak regressor $h_t$ using weighted samples\n",
    "   - Calculate individual error for each sample\n",
    "   - Compute weighted error: $\\epsilon_t = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} D_t(i)E_t(i)$\n",
    "   - Calculate regressor weight: $w_t = \\log((1-\\epsilon_t)/\\epsilon_t)$\n",
    "   - Update sample weights for next iteration\n",
    "\n",
    "## Training Process\n",
    "The training process involves these main steps:\n",
    "1. **Initialize**: Start with equal weights for all training samples\n",
    "2. **Iterate**:\n",
    "   - Train a weak regressor on weighted training data\n",
    "   - Calculate prediction errors and regressor weight\n",
    "   - Update sample weights (increase weights of poorly predicted samples)\n",
    "   - Add weighted regressor to ensemble\n",
    "3. **Combine**: Final prediction is weighted median of all regressors\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Parameters\n",
    "- `n_estimators`: Controls the number of weak regressors (default=50)\n",
    "- `learning_rate`: Shrinks the contribution of each regressor (default=1.0)\n",
    "- `loss`: Type of loss function to use ('linear', 'square', 'exponential')\n",
    "- `estimator`: Base regressor to use (default=DecisionTreeRegressor(max_depth=3))\n",
    "\n",
    "### Differences from Gradient Boosting\n",
    "1. **Weight Updates**: AdaBoost updates sample weights, while gradient boosting fits to residuals\n",
    "2. **Base Estimators**: AdaBoost typically uses shallow trees, while gradient boosting can use deeper trees\n",
    "3. **Error Correction**: AdaBoost focuses on hard examples through weight updates, while gradient boosting directly optimizes the loss function\n",
    "4. **Prediction**: AdaBoost uses weighted median for final prediction, while gradient boosting uses sum of predictions"

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Description:**\n",
    "- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** is a widely used metric for evaluating the accuracy of regression models.\n",
    "- It measures the average squared difference between the predicted values ($y_{\\text{pred}}$) and the actual target values ($y_{\\text{true}}$).\n",
    "- The squared differences are averaged across all data points in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interpretation:**\n",
    "- A lower MSE indicates a better fit of the model to the data, as it means the model's predictions are closer to the actual values.\n",
    "- MSE is sensitive to outliers because the squared differences magnify the impact of large errors.\n",
    "- **Limitations:**\n",
    "  - MSE can be hard to interpret because it is in squared units of the target variable.\n",
    "  - It disproportionately penalizes larger errors due to the squaring process.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "### 2. Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\\text{RMSE} = \\sqrt{\\text{MSE}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Description:**\n",
    "- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)** is a variant of MSE that provides the square root of the average squared difference between predicted and actual values.\n",
    "- It is often preferred because it is in the same unit as the target variable, making it more interpretable.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interpretation:**\n",
    "- Like MSE, a lower RMSE indicates a better fit of the model to the data.\n",
    "- RMSE is also sensitive to outliers due to the square root operation.\n",
    "- **Advantages over MSE:**\n",
    "  - RMSE provides a more intuitive interpretation since it is in the same scale as the target variable.\n",
    "  - It can be more directly compared to the values of the actual data.\n",

    "- **R-squared ($R^2$)**, also known as the coefficient of determination, measures the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable ($y_{\\text{true}}$) that is predictable from the independent variable(s) ($y_{\\text{pred}}$) in a regression model.\n",
    "- It ranges from 0 to 1, where 0 indicates that the model does not explain any variance, and 1 indicates a perfect fit.\n",

    "**Interpretation:**\n",
    "- A higher $R^2$ value suggests that the model explains a larger proportion of the variance in the target variable.\n",
    "- However, $R^2$ does not provide information about the goodness of individual predictions or whether the model is overfitting or underfitting.\n",
    "- **Limitations:**\n",
    "  - $R^2$ can be misleading in cases of overfitting, especially with polynomial regression models. Even if $R^2$ is high, the model may not generalize well to unseen data.\n",
    "  - It doesn’t penalize for adding irrelevant predictors, so adjusted $R^2$ is often preferred for models with multiple predictors.\n",

    "### 4. Adjusted R-squared\n",
    "\n",
    "**Formula:**\n",

    "\\text{Adjusted } R^2 = 1 - \\left(1 - R^2\\right) \\frac{n-1}{n-p-1}\n",
    "$$\n",

    "\n",
    "**Description:**\n",
    "- **Adjusted R-squared** adjusts the R-squared value to account for the number of predictors in the model, helping to prevent overfitting when adding more terms to the model.\n",
    "- Unlike $R^2$, it can decrease if the additional predictors do not improve the model significantly.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interpretation:**\n",
    "- A higher adjusted $R^2$ suggests that the model is not just overfitting, but has genuine explanatory power with the number of predictors taken into account.\n",
    "- It is especially useful when comparing models with different numbers of predictors.\n",

    "**Description:**\n",
    "- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)** measures the average of the absolute errors between the predicted and actual values.\n",
    "- Unlike MSE and RMSE, MAE is not sensitive to outliers because it does not square the errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interpretation:**\n",
    "- MAE provides a straightforward understanding of the average error magnitude.\n",
    "- A lower MAE suggests better model accuracy, but it may not highlight the impact of large errors as much as MSE or RMSE."
