    "## Theory\n",
    "Support Vector Regressor (SVR) is a regression model based on the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm. It is designed to find a function that approximates the target variable while maintaining a margin of tolerance for the error. The goal of SVR is to find a function that lies within a predefined margin (epsilon) from the actual data points, with the least amount of error outside this margin. The SVR aims to achieve both a low training error and high generalization ability by controlling the complexity of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model function for SVR is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ f(x) = w^T x + b $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- $f(x)$ is the predicted output.\n",
    "- $w$ is the weight vector (the model coefficients).\n",
    "- $x$ is the input feature vector.\n",
    "- $b$ is the bias term.\n",
    "\n",
    "SVR differs from regular SVM because it allows for errors within a margin (controlled by epsilon), and the goal is to minimize the complexity of the model while respecting the margin constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Model Training\n",
    "\n",
    "### Forward Pass\n",
    "\n",
    "In the forward pass of SVR, the model makes predictions using the learned weights and bias. The predictions are based on the learned decision function:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ f(x) = w^T x + b $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where the decision function is used to approximate the target variable, while ensuring that the margin defined by epsilon is respected.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cost Function\n",
    "\n",
    "The cost function in SVR is designed to penalize predictions that fall outside the margin. The epsilon-insensitive loss function is used, which penalizes predictions that are further than epsilon from the actual target value. The cost function is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ J(w,b,\\epsilon) = \\frac{1}{2} \\|w\\|^2 + C \\sum_{i=1}^{m} \\max(0, |f(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)}| - \\epsilon) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- $J(w,b,\\epsilon)$ is the cost function.\n",
    "- $w$ is the weight vector.\n",
    "- $b$ is the bias.\n",
    "- $m$ is the number of training examples.\n",
    "- $x^{(i)}$ and $y^{(i)}$ are the input and actual output for the $i$-th example.\n",
    "- $\\epsilon$ is the margin of tolerance for errors.\n",
    "- $C$ is the regularization parameter that controls the trade-off between model complexity and the margin of tolerance.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first term, $\\frac{1}{2} \\|w\\|^2$, represents the regularization term that aims to minimize the model complexity (i.e., finding a simpler model with smaller weights). The second term penalizes data points that fall outside the epsilon margin.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Gradient Computation\n",
    "\n",
    "The gradient of the cost function with respect to the weights and bias is computed to update the model parameters during training. The update equations are based on the principle of minimizing the error, while also ensuring that the margin constraints are satisfied.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Training Process\n",
    "\n",
    "The training process of an SVR involves finding the optimal weights ($w$) and bias ($b$) that minimize the cost function while satisfying the epsilon margin. This is typically done through convex optimization techniques such as Quadratic Programming (QP) or using more efficient algorithms like Sequential Minimal Optimization (SMO).\n",
    "\n",
    "The steps are as follows:\n",
    "1. **Initial prediction**: Start with an initial guess for the weights and bias, often set to zero.\n",
    "2. **Compute loss**: Calculate the loss function based on the current weights and bias, including both the margin constraint and the regularization term.\n",
    "3. **Update parameters**: Update the weights and bias using optimization techniques like gradient descent or SMO to minimize the cost function.\n",
    "4. **Repeat**: Repeat the process until the model parameters converge or a stopping criterion is met.\n",
    "\n",
    "SVR also supports tuning of hyperparameters such as the regularization parameter $C$, the margin parameter $\\epsilon$, and the kernel used in the transformation of the input space (e.g., linear, polynomial, or RBF kernels).\n",
    "\n",
    "By adjusting the regularization and margin parameters, SVR can be optimized to make accurate predictions while avoiding overfitting, providing a robust model for regression tasks.\n"

    "**Interpretation:**\n",
    "- A lower MSE indicates a better fit of the model to the data, as it means the model's predictions are closer to the actual values.\n",
    "- MSE is sensitive to outliers because the squared differences magnify the impact of large errors.\n",
    "- **Limitations:**\n",
    "  - MSE can be hard to interpret because it is in squared units of the target variable.\n",
    "  - It disproportionately penalizes larger errors due to the squaring process.\n",

    "- RMSE is also sensitive to outliers due to the square root operation.\n",
    "- **Advantages over MSE:**\n",
