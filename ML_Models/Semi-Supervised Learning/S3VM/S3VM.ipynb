    "## Theory\n",
    "S3VM is a semi-supervised learning technique that combines labeled and unlabeled data to improve the performance of a Support Vector Machine (SVM). In typical SVM, only labeled data is used to find a decision boundary, but in S3VM, both labeled and unlabeled data are considered. The key idea is to find a decision boundary that not only separates the labeled data but also best fits the unlabeled data, by treating them as if they belong to the correct class based on model confidence.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main idea is to:\n",
    "- Train an initial SVM classifier using a small set of labeled data.\n",
    "- Use the classifier to predict labels for the unlabeled data.\n",
    "- Treat the most confident predictions from the classifier as additional labeled data.\n",
    "- Update the classifier by including these new pseudo-labels and repeat the process until convergence.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Mathematical Foundation\n",
    "- **Model Training**:\n",
    "  In SVM, the objective is to find a hyperplane \\( f(x) \\) that maximizes the margin between classes. This is formulated as:\n",
    "  $$ \\min_w \\frac{1}{2} \\| w \\|^2 \\quad \\text{subject to} \\quad y_i(w \\cdot x_i + b) \\geq 1 \\quad \\forall i \\in L $$\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Unlabeled Data Contribution**:\n",
    "  For unlabeled data \\( U = \\{ x_{n+1}, x_{n+2}, ..., x_{n+m} \\} \\), the classifier is used to predict pseudo-labels \\( \\hat{y}_i \\) based on the decision boundary:\n",
    "  $$ \\hat{y}_i = \\text{sign}(w \\cdot x_i + b) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Objective Function**:\n",
    "  The objective function of S3VM includes both labeled and pseudo-labeled data, penalizing for misclassifications:\n",
    "  $$ \\min_w \\frac{1}{2} \\| w \\|^2 + C_L \\sum_{i \\in L} \\mathcal{L}(y_i, f(x_i)) + C_U \\sum_{i \\in U} \\mathcal{L}(\\hat{y}_i, f(x_i)) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "  where:\n",
    "  - \\( C_L \\) and \\( C_U \\) are regularization parameters for labeled and unlabeled data.\n",
    "  - \\( \\mathcal{L} \\) is a loss function (e.g., hinge loss for classification).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Algorithm Steps\n",
    "1. **Initialization**:\n",
    "   - Start with a small labeled dataset \\( L \\) and a large unlabeled dataset \\( U \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Initial SVM Training**:\n",
    "   - Train an SVM model \\( f \\) using the labeled dataset \\( L \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Predict Pseudo-Labels**:\n",
    "   - Use the model \\( f \\) to predict pseudo-labels for the unlabeled dataset \\( U \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Select Confident Predictions**:\n",
    "   - Choose the most confident predictions based on the margin from the SVM decision boundary:\n",
    "     $$ \\text{Confidence}(x_i) = |w \\cdot x_i + b| $$\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Dataset Update**:\n",
    "   - Add the most confident pseudo-labeled examples to the labeled dataset \\( L \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Model Retraining**:\n",
    "   - Retrain the SVM model using the updated labeled dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Repeat**:\n",
    "   - Repeat the process of prediction, selection, and retraining until convergence or a stopping criterion is met.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Parameters\n",
    "- **C_L**: Regularization parameter for labeled data.\n",
    "- **C_U**: Regularization parameter for unlabeled data.\n",
    "- **kernel**: The kernel function used for the SVM (e.g., linear, RBF).\n",
    "- **max_iter**: The maximum number of iterations for the algorithm.\n",
    "- **threshold**: The confidence threshold for selecting pseudo-labeled data.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Advantages\n",
    "- Can improve the SVM model by using unlabeled data.\n",
    "- Effective when labeled data is scarce or expensive to obtain.\n",
    "- Flexible to different kernel functions and model types.\n",
    "- Can handle large amounts of unlabeled data.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Disadvantages\n",
    "- Sensitive to the quality of the pseudo-labels.\n",
    "- May propagate errors if the model is not confident in its predictions.\n",
    "- Requires careful tuning of regularization parameters \\( C_L \\) and \\( C_U \\).\n",
    "- Computationally expensive due to retraining after each update.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Implementation Tips\n",
    "- Use a **well-calibrated SVM** to ensure reliable confidence scores for pseudo-labels.\n",
    "- Start with a **diverse labeled dataset** to avoid bias in initial model predictions.\n",
    "- Consider using a **smaller confidence threshold** initially to avoid incorrect pseudo-labels.\n",
    "- Use **cross-validation** to monitor the performance of the model during updates.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Applications\n",
    "- Text classification (e.g., sentiment analysis, topic classification).\n",
    "- Image classification (e.g., object detection, facial recognition).\n",
    "- Bioinformatics (e.g., protein classification, gene expression).\n",
    "- Speech recognition (e.g., speaker identification).\n",
    "- Anomaly detection in various domains (e.g., fraud detection, system monitoring).\n",
    "\n",
    "S3VM is a powerful technique for semi-supervised learning, particularly in scenarios where labeled data is limited but large amounts of unlabeled data are available. While it requires careful tuning and evaluation, it can significantly improve the model's performance in many real-world applications.\n"
